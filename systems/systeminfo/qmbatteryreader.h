 *
 * Declaration of properties makes it easy to access these information form QML environment.
 * For each class property there is a get function for reading the value. NOTIFY signal
 * is emitted whenever the value of the property changes.
 *
 * QmBattery class which is part of QmSystem2 library provides information on device battery
 * status.
